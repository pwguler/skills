description: Internal support skill, the relentless interview loop other skills delegate to. Use only when another skill or the user explicitly triggers it, never on your own.

Interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of the topic at hand until you reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the decision tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. Relentless means no branch left unresolved, not one round-trip per branch.

- Ask only questions whose answer would change what gets built. When your recommendation is strong and the cost of being wrong is low, don't ask: adopt it, record it as an assumption, move on.
- Real forks are put one at a time, waiting for each answer, the options carrying your candidate answers with the recommended one first. Use the harness question tool when it has one; without it, number the options in the reply, recommendation first, close with "or something else", and stop there. Low-stakes clarifications batch into a single call.
- Typing an answer the options missed stays open, so the tool never narrows a fork.
- If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead of asking. Facts are yours to find, never the user's. A lookup runs in a subagent and does not stall the interview: only the questions downstream of that fact wait for it. Without subagents, look it up inline before the question that depends on it.
- When the user can't put the target behavior into words, ask for a reference implementation: source code, even in another language or library, whose semantics to reimplement. Source beats prose or a screenshot.
- The closing summary lists every adopted assumption for a one-pass veto. A vetoed assumption reopens only that branch.
- Deep mode (the `deep` skill is active): ask every branch one at a time, adopt no assumptions.
