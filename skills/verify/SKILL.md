description: Prove a claim of done, fixed, or passing by running the commands and reading the output before making it. Use before claiming work is complete, fixed, or tested, and before committing or opening a PR.
---

Evidence before assertion. A claim without a fresh command run behind it is not made.

1. Name the claim about to be made: "done", "fixed", "passes", "works".
2. Run the commands that would prove it false: the tests, the build, the linter, and the actual behavior that changed.
3. When a spec exists at `docs/specs/<slug>.md`, gate criterion by criterion: run each criterion's verification command and quote the output that proves it. Then check the diff against the spec's non-goals; a change inside fenced scope fails the claim even with green tests. A spec that still carries an `## Open decisions` section is a draft, and a draft proves nothing: no claim can be made against it; route back to `drill`.
4. Exercise the changed path end to end, not only its unit tests. If the change has a runtime surface, drive it.
5. Read the output. Passing means the output says passing, not that the command exited.
6. State what was run and what it showed. If it broke, say it broke, with the output.

Rules:

- Default stance: reject. A claim is false until fresh output proves it; the implementer's word is not evidence.
- Never claim from memory of an earlier run; re-run after the last edit.
- A skipped check is reported as skipped, not implied as passing.
- Review feedback is a claim: verify it before implementing. Unclear feedback is checked, not obeyed.
- Partial verification gets a partial claim: "tests pass; behavior not exercised" is honest, "done" is not.
- A claim no command can prove (good design, not slop, reads well) is a taste claim: route it to the `rubric` skill, which judges against written criteria by a fresh subagent.
- Fast path (one-sentence plan, no spec file): the gate is that sentence's criterion, not the whole suite. Run only the tests that exercise the change; the changed path still runs end to end.
- Deep mode (the `deep` skill is active): exercise the changed path end to end unconditionally and gate every criterion; a partial claim is not accepted as final.
