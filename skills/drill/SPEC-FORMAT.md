# Spec Format

One spec per work item, at `docs/specs/<slug>.md` in the target project. `drill` creates it when the decision tree resolves into implementation work; `land` closes it when the branch closes, keeping the file unless the user asks for it to go. A spec steers a branch; keeping it afterward is a choice, not the default state of the world.

A spec has two states, derived from its content, not a status field:

- **Draft**: the plan is not settled yet. The spec carries the open decisions that must be resolved before implementation can start. `drill` writes it this way when the decision tree cannot resolve within one session (decisions await research, or the tree is too large for one context).
- **Settled**: every open decision is resolved, the `## Open decisions` section is gone, and the spec carries goal, non-goals, acceptance criteria, and verification commands. Only a settled spec steers `implement` and `verify`.

The transition is mechanical: resolve the open decisions one session at a time, and when the last one closes, delete the `## Open decisions` section. The spec does not need rewriting; it matures in place.

## Draft template

```markdown
# <slug>: draft

## Destination
One or two lines: what reaching the end of this effort looks like: the spec, decision, or change this is finding its way to. Every session orients to this before picking a decision.

## Decisions so far
- [<decision name>]: one-line gist of the answer

## Open decisions
### <decision name> · Mode: AFK
<the question this decision resolves. One session can hold it.>

### <decision name> · Mode: HITL
<the question. Resolves only through a live exchange with the user.>

## Not yet specified
<fog: decisions you can see coming but cannot yet phrase sharply enough to ticket. Graduates into Open decisions as the frontier advances.>

## Out of scope
<work ruled beyond the destination. Closed, never graduates.>
```

## Settled template

```markdown
# <slug>

## Goal
One sentence: what this work item delivers.

## Non-goals
What this work must not touch or change. These fence the diff.

## Acceptance criteria
- AC-1: <a checkable statement; a command or test can prove it true or false>
- AC-2: ...

## Verification
The exact commands that prove the criteria, one per line.
```

## Rules

- Every criterion is checkable. If no command or test can prove it, rewrite it until one can.
- Non-goals are load-bearing: `verify` fails work that changes what a non-goal fences off.
- The spec states the destination, not the route: no implementation steps, no file lists.
- Durable residue is routed out regardless of the spec file's fate: decisions go to `docs/adr/`, settled terms to `CONTEXT.md`. A kept spec is a record of one branch's reasoning, not a substitute for that routing.

## Draft rules

- **Mode is who resolves the decision.** `AFK` (away from keyboard): the `research` skill resolves it alone, run in parallel from the session that wrote the draft when the harness dispatches subagents and one at a time otherwise, writing its findings to `docs/research/<slug>-<decision-slug>.md`. `HITL` (human in the loop): only a live exchange with the user resolves it; an agent answering its own HITL question has broken the loop.
- **One decision per session**, except research decisions already dispatched as subagents. Claim the decision you work: mark it claimed before starting.
- **Refer to decisions by name**, never by number or slug. Names read at a glance; ids do not.
- **Fog or decision?** The test is whether you can state the question precisely now, not whether you can answer it now. Sharp question → `Open decisions`; too coarse to phrase → `Not yet specified`.
- **A decision that turns out to sit beyond the destination is ruled out of scope**, not resolved. Close it and leave one line in `Out of scope`; it does not enter `Decisions so far`.
- `verify` and `implement` refuse a draft: a spec that still carries `## Open decisions` is routed back to `drill`.
